##The Spick Buster
============

This a Simple game made for a gamejam in less than 3 days.


You can Move using "W-A-S-D" or Arrow keys. You can shoot using "left mouse click"
The Game is pretty simple, you just have to shoot or dodge the "Red Spikes",
but if the number of the red spike increases and you're  unable to handle it any more, you can seek help from your "AI Friend" which can be brought instantly at your desired position by pressing "Space" or "Enter". They are pretty strong and will help you shoot  the spikes. But , Alas!  You cannot trust them all the time because the longer they live the chance of them turning against you increases.

Now that's why I would say "Be careful when forging your AI Friend". Do not trust anyone.

This game was made in 3 days for BenBonk Game Jam#1.
